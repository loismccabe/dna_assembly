# dna_assembly
Assemble a DNA sequence given a number of DNA fragments

## Code layout

- Code is in ./code
- DNA fragments in ./seq_frags

The data file contains the original DNA sequence. The next part of the data are fragments from the same DNA sequence. These are the fragments that are assembled to recreate the original sequence. The program prints original and recreated sequence to confirm that the re-assembled sequence is (at least) the same length. Visual inspection can be used to confirm.
